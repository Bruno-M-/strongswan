                  strongSwan - Roadmap
                 -------------------------

These notes mostly belong to charon, the new IKEv2 daemon. The plan is to
migrate IKEv1 into charon. It's hard to say how much effort is needed to
do that, and how much code we can reuse from pluto. But a port IS necessary to
gain hassle-free configuration, version negotiation and maintainability.

TODO-List
=========

A set of TODOs. This is only a list of things I write down to not forget them.
Watch out for TODOs in the code.

Build options
-------------
- Allow static build using libtool dlopen wrapper

Certificate support
-------------------
- New trustchain mechanism?
- proper handling of multiple certificate payloads (import order)
- synchronized CRL fetcher
- Smartcard interface
- Attribute certificates

Stroke interface
----------------
- add a Rekey-Counter for SAs in "statusall"
- ipsec statusall bytecount

Misc
----
- Address pool/backend for virtual IP assignement
- fix iterator->insert_before/after
- split up kernel interface into:  ipsec, routing, interfaces
