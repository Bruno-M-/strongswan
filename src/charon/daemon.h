 *
 * @brief IKEv2 keying daemon.
 *
 * @section Architecture
 *
 * All IKEv2 stuff is handled in charon. It uses a newer and more flexible
 * architecture than pluto. Charon uses a thread-pool, which allows parallel
 * execution SA-management. Beside the thread-pool, there are some special purpose
 * threads which do their job for the common health of the daemon.

   @endverbatim
 * The thread-pool is the heart of the architecture. It processes jobs from a
 * (fully synchronized) job-queue. Mostly, a job is associated with a specific
 * IKE SA. These IKE SAs are synchronized, only one thread can work one an IKE SA.
 * This makes it unnecesary to use further synchronisation methods once a IKE SA
 * is checked out. The (rather complex) synchronization of IKE SAs is completely
 * done in the IKE SA manager.
 * The sceduler is responsible for event firing. It waits until a event in the
 * (fully synchronized) event-queue is ready for processing and pushes the event
 * down to the job-queue. A thread form the pool will pick it up as quick as
 * possible. Every thread can queue events or jobs. Furter, an event can place a
 * packet in the sender. The sender thread waits for those packets and sends
 * them over the wire, via the socket. The receiver does exactly the opposite of
 * the sender. It waits on the socket, reads in packets an places them on the
 * job-queue for further processing by a thread from the pool.
 * There are even more threads, not drawn in the upper scheme. The stroke thread
 * is responsible for reading and processessing commands from another process. The
 * kernel interface thread handles communication from and to the kernel via a
 * netlink socket. It waits for kernel events and processes them appropriately.
