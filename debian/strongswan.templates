Description: When to start strongSwan:
 There are three possibilities when strongSwan can start: before or
 after the NFS services and after the PCMCIA services. The correct answer
 depends on your specific setup.
 .
 If you do not have your /usr tree mounted via NFS (either you only mount
 other, less vital trees via NFS or don't use NFS mounted trees at all) and
 don't use a PCMCIA network card, then it's best to start strongSwan at
 the earliest possible time, thus allowing the NFS mounts to be secured by
 IPSec. In this case (or if you don't understand or care about this
 issue), answer "earliest" to this question (the default).
 .
 If you have your /usr tree mounted via NFS and don't use a PCMCIA network
 card, then you will need to start strongSwan after NFS so that all
 necessary files are available. In this case, answer "after NFS" to this
 question. Please note that the NFS mount of /usr can not be secured by
 IPSec in this case.
 .
 If you use a PCMCIA network card for your IPSec connections, then you only
 have to choose to start it after the PCMCIA services. Answer "after
 PCMCIA" in this case. This is also the correct answer if you want to fetch
 keys from a locally running DNS server with DNSSec support.

Template: strongswan/restart
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Do you wish to restart strongSwan?
 Restarting strongSwan is a good idea, since if there is a security fix, it
 will not be fixed until the daemon restarts. Most people expect the daemon
 to restart, so this is generally a good idea. However this might take down
 existing connections and then bring them back up.

Template: strongswan/create_rsa_key
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Do you want to create a RSA public/private keypair for this host?
 This installer can automatically create a RSA public/private keypair for
 this host. This keypair can be used to authenticate IPSec connections to
 other hosts and is the preferred way for building up secure IPSec
 connections. The other possibility would be to use shared secrets
 (passwords that are the same on both sides of the tunnel) for
 authenticating an connection, but for a larger number of connections RSA
 authentication is easier to administer and more secure.
 .
 If you do not want to create a new public/private keypair, you can choose to
 use an existing one.

Template: strongswan/rsa_key_type
Type: select
Choices: x509, plain
Choices-cs.UTF-8: x509, prostý
Choices-fr.UTF-8: X509, Simple paire
Choices-ja.UTF-8: x509, 通常のタイプ
Choices-nl.UTF-8: x509, gewoon
Choices-pt_BR.UTF-8: x509, pura
Choices-sv.UTF-8: x509, enkel
Choices-vi.UTF-8: x509, giản dị
Default: x509
Description: The type of RSA keypair to create:
 It is possible to create a plain RSA public/private keypair for use
 with strongSwan or to create a X509 certificate file which contains the RSA
 public key and additionally stores the corresponding private key.
 .
 If you only want to build up IPSec connections to hosts also running
 strongSwan, it might be a bit easier using plain RSA keypairs. But if you
 want to connect to other IPSec implementations, you will need a X509
 certificate. It is also possible to create a X509 certificate here and
 extract the RSA public key in plain format if the other side runs
 strongSwan without X509 certificate support.
 .
 Therefore a X509 certificate is recommended since it is more flexible and
 this installer should be able to hide the complex creation of the X509
 certificate and its use in strongSwan anyway.

Template: strongswan/existing_x509_certificate
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Do you have an existing X509 certificate file for strongSwan?
 This installer can automatically extract the needed information from an
 existing X509 certificate with a matching RSA private key. Both parts can
 be in one file, if it is in PEM format. If you have such an existing
 certificate and key file and want to use it for authenticating IPSec
 connections, then please answer yes.

Template: strongswan/existing_x509_certificate_filename
Type: string
Description: File name of your X509 certificate in PEM format:
 Please enter the full location of the file containing your X509 
 certificate in PEM format.

Template: strongswan/existing_x509_key_filename
Type: string
Description: File name of your X509 private key in PEM format:
 Please enter the full location of the file containing the private RSA key
 matching your X509 certificate in PEM format. This can be the same file
 that contains the X509 certificate.

Template: strongswan/rsa_key_length
Type: string
Default: 2048
Description: The length of the created RSA key (in bits):
 Please enter the length of the created RSA key. it should not be less than
 1024 bits because this should be considered unsecure and you will probably
 not need anything more than 2048 bits because it only slows the
 authentication process down and is not needed at the moment.

Template: strongswan/x509_self_signed
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Do you want to create a self-signed X509 certificate?
 This installer can only create self-signed X509 certificates
 automatically, because otherwise a certificate authority is needed to sign
 the certificate request. If you want to create a self-signed certificate,
 you can use it immediately to connect to other IPSec hosts that support
 X509 certificate for authentication of IPSec connections. However, if you
 want to use the new PKI features of strongSwan >= 1.91, you will need to
 have all X509 certificates signed by a single certificate authority to
 create a trust path.
 .
 If you do not want to create a self-signed certificate, then this
 installer will only create the RSA private key and the certificate request
 and you will have to sign the certificate request with your certificate
 authority.

Template: strongswan/x509_country_code
Type: string
Default: AT
Description: Country code for the X509 certificate request:
 Please enter the 2 letter country code for your country. This code will be
 placed in the certificate request. 
 .
 You really need to enter a valid country code here, because openssl will
 refuse to generate certificates without one. An empty field is allowed for
 any other field of the X.509 certificate, but not for this one.
 .
 Example: AT

Template: strongswan/x509_state_name
Type: string
Default:
Description: State or province name for the X509 certificate request:
 Please enter the full name of the state or province you live in. This name
 will be placed in the certificate request.
 .
 Example: Upper Austria

Template: strongswan/x509_locality_name
Type: string
Default: 
Description: Locality name for the X509 certificate request:
 Please enter the locality (e.g. city) where you live. This name will be
 placed in the certificate request.
 .
 Example: Vienna

Template: strongswan/x509_organization_name
Type: string
Default: 
Description: Organization name for the X509 certificate request:
 Please enter the organization (e.g. company) that the X509 certificate
 should be created for. This name will be placed in the certificate
 request.
 .
 Example: Debian

Template: strongswan/x509_organizational_unit
Type: string
Default: 
Description: Organizational unit for the X509 certificate request:
 Please enter the organizational unit (e.g. section) that the X509
 certificate should be created for. This name will be placed in the
 certificate request.
 .
 Example: security group

Template: strongswan/x509_common_name
Type: string
Default: 
Description: Common name for the X509 certificate request:
 Please enter the common name (e.g. the host name of this machine) for
 which the X509 certificate should be created for. This name will be placed
 in the certificate request.
 .
 Example: gateway.debian.org

Template: strongswan/x509_email_address
Type: string
Default: 
Description: Email address for the X509 certificate request:
 Please enter the email address of the person or organization who is
 responsible for the X509 certificate, This address will be placed in the
 certificate request.

Template: strongswan/enable-oe
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Do you wish to enable opportunistic encryption in strongSwan?
 strongSwan comes with support for opportunistic encryption (OE), which stores
 IPSec authentication information (i.e. RSA public keys) in (preferably
 secure) DNS records. Until this is widely deployed, activating it will
 cause a significant slow-down for every new, outgoing connection. Since
 version 2.0, strongSwan upstream comes with OE enabled by default and is thus
 likely to break your existing connection to the Internet (i.e. your default
 route) as soon as pluto (the strongSwan keying daemon) is started.
 .
 Please choose whether you want to enable support for OE. If unsure, do not
 enable it.
