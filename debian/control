Description: IPsec VPN solution metapackage
 strongSwan is a IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 strongSwan is one of the two remaining forks of the original FreeS/WAN 
 project and focuses on IKEv2 support, X.509 authentication and complete PKI 
 support. For a focus on Opportunistic Encryption (OE) and interoperability 
 with non-standard IPsec features, see Openswan.
 .
 This metapackage has dependencies to the IKEv1 daemon pluto and IKEv2 daemon
 charon. It installs the required packages to run IKEv1 and IKEv2 connections
 using a ipsec.conf/ipsec.secrets based configuration.

Description: strongSwan utility and crypto library
 strongSwan is a IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 libstrongswan is the underlying library of charon and other strongSwan
 components. It is built in a modular way and is extendable through various
 plugins.

Description: strongSwan daemon starter and configuration file parser
 strongSwan is a IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 The starter and the associated "ipsec" script control both pluto and charon
 from the command line. It parses ipsec.conf and loads the configurations to
 the daemons. While the IKEv2 daemon can use other configuration backends, the
 IKEv1 daemon is limited to configurations from ipsec.conf.

Description: strongSwan IKEv1 keying daemon
 strongSwan is a IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 Pluto is a IPsec IKEv1 keying daemon. It was inherited from the FreeS/WAN
 project, but provides improved X.509 certificate support and other features.
 .
 Pluto can run in parallel with charon, the newer IKEv2 daemon.

Description: strongSwan IKEv2 keying daemon
 strongSwan is a IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 Charon is the IPsec IKEv2 keying daemon of the strongSwan project. It is
 written from scratch using a fully multi-threaded design and a modular
 architecture. Various plugins provide additional functionality.
 .
 This build of charon can run in parallel with pluto, the IKEv1 daemon.

Description: strongSwan plugin to interact with NetworkManager
 strongSwan is a IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It uses the
 native IPsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
 It supports both IKEv1 and the newer IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This plugin provides an interface which allows NetworkManager to configure
 and control the IKEv2 daemon directly through DBUS. It is designed to work
 in conjunction with the network-manager-strongswan package, providing
 a simple graphical frontend to configure IPsec based VPNs.
