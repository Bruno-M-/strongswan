strongswan (4.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with strongswan 4.5.0 upstream, the IKEv2 protocol is now the
  default. This can easily be changed using the keyexchange=ikev1 config
  option (either in the respective "conn" section or by putting it in the
  "default" section and therefore applying it to all existing connections).

  The IKEv2 protocol has less overhead, more features (e.g. NAT-Traversal by
  default, MOBIKE, Mobile IPv6), and provides better error messages in case
  the connection can not be established. It is therefore highly recommended
  to use it when the other side also supports it.
