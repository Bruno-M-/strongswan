openswan (1:2.4.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed kernel-patch-openswan to linux-patch-openswan.
  * Removed the remarks in the package descriptions that linux-patch-openswan
    and openswan-modules-source will only work with 2.4 series kernels. This
    is no longer true.
  * Use updated French translation. Thanks to Christian Perrier and sorry for
    not giving time to update the translations before the last upload. I felt
    that the FTBFS should be corrected quickly.

openswan (1:2.4.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The NMU patch doesn't seem to have applied to debian/control,
    because the dependency was still on libopensc1-dev. Fixed that now
    by adding libopensc2-dev.
    Closes: #363073: openswan_1:2.4.5-1: FTBFS: Build depends on 
                     libopensc1-dev
  * Added the patch to fix alignment issues on Sparc, as upstream acknowledged
    it and applied it to their development tree.
    Closes: #341630: openswan: Pluto crypto helper gets SIGBUS on SPARC due 
                     to request memory alignment issue

openswan (1:2.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This release adds support for patching newer kernel
    versions. Verified that the patched kernel tree compiles with Debian 
    kernel sources 2.6.15-8 and 2.6.16-6.
    Closes: #361800: kernel-patch-openswan: Fails to patch Debian 2.6.15 
                     kernel
    It also adds the patches for an IPSec/L2TP server behind a NAT.
    Closes: #307529: More patches for openswan server behind NAT
    Closes: #353792: openswan nat-t failure
    And additionally there are (according to upstream changelogs) fixes for
    running on SMP systems. If the following bug still persists (can not test
    myself), then please reopen.
    Closes: #343603: kernel-patch-openswan: Starting IPSEC makes system freeze 
    The patch to fix the snmpd crash is also in this upstream version (just
    checked linux/net/ipsec/ipsec_tunnel.c). It was probably in older versions
    as well, so this might have been closed earlier. It's not mentioned in 
    upstream changelog, so I don't know exactly when it has been fixed.
    Closes: #318298: kernel-patch-openswan: Kernel Oops - Null Dereference 
                     when using snmpd 
    The ipsec.conf manual page has been updated to document connaddrfamily.
    Closes: #296611: openswan: "man -S 5 ipsec.conf" fails to mention the 
                     parameter "connaddrfamily"
  * Acknowledge fixes in last NMU - thanks to Christian.

    uses dpatch, so now Build-Depend on it.
    Closes: #354965: openswan: /usr/lib/ipsec/_updown uses /etc/sysconfig/, 
                     please change to /etc/default/ 
  * Only ask if an existing certificate/private key pair should be used when
    the user chose not to create a new key pair. Also mention, when asking to
    create a new key pair, that an existing one can be used alternatively.
    Closes: #298250: confusing debconf question about certificate creation
  * Move the USE_LDAP, USE_LIBCURL, and HAVE_THREADS options from the
    "make install" to the "make programs" call where it belongs.
    Closes: #292838: openswan: Dynamic CRL fetching not supported
  * Remove /usr/share/doc/openswan/index.html, because it is a duplicate of
    /usr/share/doc/openswan/doc/index.html, and only the latter one has links
    to existing files.

  * Add #ifdef to linux/net/ipsec/ipsec_init.c to branch between Debian and
    vanilla 2.4 kernels. For Debian kernels with the XFRM (26sec) backport,
    a second option is necessary for inet_(add|del)_protocol. This should 
    allow KLIPS to compile on both Debian and vanilla 2.4 kernels. Verified
    that it compiles with Debian 2.4.27-12 and vanilla 2.4.32.

  * Document in README.Debian that KLIPS for 2.4 kernels will not compile with
    newer GCC versions and give a hint on how to use older versions with
    make-kpkg.
  * Kernel 2.6.8 is not properly supported and is horribly outdated by now.
    If you really need to use 2.6.8, then please use the native 26sec IPSec
    stack. For KLIPS support, use at least 2.6.12, or better 2.6.15.

  * Also build-depend on the new libssl (>= 0.9.8-1) now to help the

    ignore this versioned build-dependency. No new API is needed this is just
    for the ABI transition.

openswan (1:2.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

openswan (1:2.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This finally allows the Debian packages to be 
    updated since the regression from 2.2.X to 2.3.X has been fixed (pluto
    crash with roadwarriors). Please be aware that pluto daemons from 2.2 or
    2.3 openswan release will still crash, so please update all your

openswan (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  Urgency HIGH because openswan is an important package for testing (at least
  in my opinion...).
  * New upstream version. This update should fix the various crashes
    that openswan 2.3.0 pluto was causing on other openswan boxes
    (occured in the wild with 2.2.0 and 2.3.0, but might also happen
    with others) in some cases.
    Closes: #292132: openswan: OpenSwan 2.2.0 crashes when a road-warrior 
            comes in using 2.3.0
  * Adapt to the new way of building modules (which changed between upstream
    version 2.2.0 and 2.3.0). openswan-modules-source should now build with
    2.4 and with 2.6 kernels (using make-kpkg).
    Closes: #291274: Fails to build with 2.4.29: missing Makefile
    Closes: #276521: openswan-modules-source: ipsec_aes.o & ipsec_cryptoapi.o 
            not kernel modules
  * Also enable building of 2.6 kernel modules in openswan-modules-source.
    Closes: #273443: openswan-modules-source: doesn't build with 2.6.8 - 
            different from #273144 (?)
  * kernel-patch-openswan also needed some changes due to the new tree
    layout (specifically the new Makefile.top). Now kernel-patch-openswan
    has been enabled to work with kernel 2.6, so you can now get ipsecX
    interfaces with kernel 2.6 (tested with vanilla 2.6.10)!
    Closes: #301801 kernel-patch-openswan: Fails to build with Debian 2.6.10 
            source
  * There was no reply by the original bug submitter, so this really seemed
    to be a toolchain problem. I can't reproduce this bug.
    Closes: #283387: openswan: Fails to build on testing (Sarge)
  * The build-dependency has already been updated from libcurl2-dev to 
    libcurl3-dev in package 2.3.0-1. Now updated it to 
    libcurl3-dev | libcurl2-dev so that backporting to woody is easier.
    Closes: #298468 openswan fails to build on sarge due to missing 
            libcurl2-dev dependancy
  * The same goes for libopensc*-dev.
  * Fixed typos in the logcheck ignore files.

    Closes: #294202: [l10n] Czech po-debconf template translation (cs.po)
  * Removed the source code for the fswcert utility from the debian/ dir in
    the source package - it is now included in the upstream source under
    programs/.
  * Removed the conflicts with ike-server (still providing it though).
    Closes: #297186: openswan: Remove conflict on ike-server
  * Don't conflict with freeswan generally, but only with versions < 2.04-12.
    (This is in preparation of the freeswan transition package that I am 
    working on.)
  * Explicitly remove the execute permissions from /etc/ipsec.d/policies/*.
    Closes: #298245: wrong permissions in /etc
  * No longer need gawk for openswan scripts to work. This allows to finally
    removed the awk-to-gawk hack in debian/rules and means that openswan no
    longer depends on gawk.
  * Enable the building of pluto code for dynamic URL fetching (which needs
    libldap2-dev and libcurl3-dev) and the XAUTH PAM support. Therefore, we
    now build-depend on libpam0g-dev.

openswan (2.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    Important change: aes-sha1 is now the default proposal (but 3des-md5 is
    still supported if the other side requests it). Please look at 
    /usr/share/doc/openswan/docs/RELEASE-NOTES for details.
  * Includes KLIPS support for kernel 2.6 for the first time, but I have not
    yet modified openswan-modules-source to cope with that. If somebody wants
    to lend me a hand to address #273443, it would be more than welcome.
  * This release includes a fix for the reported snmpd crash
    (in ipsec_tunnel.c). Many thanks to Nate Carlson for pointing this out.
    Closes: #261892: openswan: System crashes when snmpd runs at the same time
  * Update Build-Depends from libopensc0-dev to libopensc1-dev.
    Closes: #289600: openswan: can't fulfill the build dependencies
  * Update Build-Depends from libcurl2-dev to libcurl3-dev.
  * Include Japanese debconf translation and fix a typo in the master.
    Closes: #288996: openswan: Japanese po-debconf template translation 
            (ja.po) and typo in template.pot
  * Auto-apply the NAT Traversal patch with kernel-patch-openswan again. This
    was changed by openswan (the freeswan version included the NAT-T patch
    automatically). Thus, the patch is now applied before inserting the KLIPS
    part.
  * Include a ready-to-use NAT-T diff in the openswan-modules-source package
    so that anybody who uses this package still has the option of using NAT
    Traversal (though this means patching the kernel anyway, and kind of
    makes the out-of-tree compilation senseless). However, Debian 2.4 series
    kernels should already have NAT-T applied.
  * Document the above two changes in the package descriptions and 
    README.Debian.

openswan (2.2.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  Urgency medium to get this version into sarge - it fixes a bug that turned
  up on some machines and prevented openswan from starting.
  * no_oe.conf will work when there are spaces at the end, many thanks to
    Hans Fugal for figuring that out!
    Closes: #270012: openswan: Fails to start after Installation
            (/etc/ipsec.d/examples/no_oe.conf problem?)
    I am now sending this towards upstream so that it should hopefully get
    fixed for the next release - it's a bit awkward for a config file.
  * Fixed a minor aesthetical issue in openswan.postinst: when a plain RSA key
    is already present in ipsec.secrets and a new one is being created, a
    needless line was printed. Silenced by adding -q to egrep.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Oct 2004 20:57:22 +0200

openswan (2.2.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Also added flex to Build-Depends, the new starter (replacement for
    the init scripts, but not yet active) needs it to build.
    Closes: #272935: openswan_2.2.0-1(ia64/unstable): FTBFS: missing 
                     build-depends
    Closes: #273241: openswan: FTBFS: Missing Build-Depends on 'flex'

    upstream source code - need to generate a C file from a template before
    the ipsec module can be built.
    Closes: #273144: openswan-modules-source: linux/net/ipsec/version.c 
                     neither created nor compiled
  * Enabled the building of modular extensions (AES and cryptoapi) by default
    for openswan-modules-source. Also enabled the AES cipher in addition to
    3DES (this is directly in the ipsec.o kernel module, the modular 
    extensions version is an alternative to this).

openswan (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version:
    - Introduces AES support, which is the reason for urgency medium. AES 
      should definitly go into sarge.
    - Adds RFC 3706 DPD (dead peer detection) support, see 
      /usr/share/doc/openswan/docs/README.DPD for details.
    This adds the last missing piece (AES) to replace the freeswan package
    completely. As of now, freeswan is officially unsupported and will soon
    be removed from Debian. Please upgrade to openswan, which should not cause
    any issues. Configuration files and certificates are completely compatible.
    Closes: #270012: openswan: Fails to start after Installation 
                     (/etc/ipsec.d/examples/no_oe.conf problem?)
            I can no longer reproduce this problem on a fresh install of

    Closes: #260120: openswan: Patch fixing #256391 breaks the autogenerated 
                     certificate
            The new X.509 patch included in this upstream release (no longer
            patched by the Debian package) should fix this too.
    Closes: #246828: /etc/ipsec.conf refers to invalid URLs
            The default ipsec.conf file distributed by upstream no longer 
            refers to an URL.
  * Fixed a thinko in the postinst script that prevented the correct insertion
    of plain RSA keys into /etc/ipsec.secrets (i.e. not using X.509 
    certificates). Fixed now.
    Closes: #268742: openswan: Plain RSA key not successfully written to 
                     ipsec.secrets
  * Adapt to the new way of openswan handling the disabling of opportunistic
    encryption. In the default ipsec.conf distributed with upstream openswan,
    OE is now disabled (which changes the previous default). Adapted the 
    postinst script so that it can now enable and disable OE support based on
    the debconf option.
    Closes: #268743: openswan: fails to respect debconf OE setting
  * Updated the French and Brazilian Portugese debconf translations.

    But I have currently not explicitly enabled xaut support in Makefile.inc,
    quoting from there: "off by default, since XAUTH is tricky, and you can 
    get into security trouble". If it needs to be enabled to work, please tell
    me and I will need to take a far closer look on it (and the involved
    problems).
    This new upstream version also fixes a possible security issue in the
    X.509 certificate authentication.
  * The last upload didn't seem to have hit the archives, strange... 
    However, the bugs are still fixed, closing them now.
    Closes: #245450: openswan should not depend on 
            kernel-image-2.4 || kernel-image-2.6
    Closes: #246847: openswan: shouldn't conflict with ike-server
    Closes: #246373: openswan: [INTL:fr] French debconf templates translation

openswan (2.1.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied a patch from openswan CVS to fix CRL related crashes.
  * Drop the dependency on kernels it works with - the package description
    already says that it will need kernel support to work. This allows people
    to easily use self-compiled kernels with the right support (e.g. 2.6.5).
    Closes: #245450: openswan should not depend on 
            kernel-image-2.4 || kernel-image-2.6
  * While I'm at it, also replace the various Suggests: *freeswan* with
    openswan. Oops.
  * openswan conflicts with ike-server because only one ike-server can be
    active at any given time (it will listen on UDP port 500). This policy
    has been agreed to by all Debian IPSec package maintainers and implemented
    in all ike-server providing packages.
    Closes: #246847: openswan: shouldn't conflict with ike-server
  * Took the debconf translations from the freeswan package and "ported" them
    via debconf-updatepo. Thanks to Christian Perrier for mentioning that it
    was this easy.
    The templates should now be correct (all instances of FreeS/wan replaced
    by Openswan).

openswan (2.1.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the kernel-patch-openswan apply script.
  * Warning: Due to an upstream bug, pluto from this version will dump core 
    on certain CRLs. If you are hit by this bug, please report it directly to 
    upstream, they are still tracking the issue down.

openswan (2.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Also build the openswan-modules-source and kernel-patch-openswan

  * Fixed _startklips in combination with the native IPSec stack - many thanks
    to Nate Carlson for the patch.

openswan (2.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Took the package as official maintainer.
  * Updated all relevant packaging stuff to the level of freeswan 2.04-9,
    including auto-generation of X.509 certificates and insertion in 
    ipsec.secrets. This also corrects the libexec path in some scripts.

openswan (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
