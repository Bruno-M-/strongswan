strongswan (2.7.2+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload to the main Debian archive. This does no longer build
    the linux-patch-strongswan and strongswan-modules-source packages,
    as KLIPS will be removed from the strongswan upstream source anyway
    for the next major release. However, the openswan KLIPS could should
    be interoperable with strongswan user space.
    Closes: #372267: ITP: strongswan -- second fork of freeswan.
  * This upload removes the draft RFCs, as they are not considered free under
    the DFSG.

strongswan (2.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian packaging of strongswan. This is directly based on my
    Debian package of openswan 2.4.5-3.
  * Do not compile and ship fswcert right now, because it is not included
    in strongswan upstream. If it turns out to be necessary for supporting
    easy-to-use OE in the future (i.e. for generating the DNS format for the
    public keys from generated X.509 certificates), I will re-add it to the
    Debian package.
  * Also disabled my patches to use /etc/default instead of /etc/sysconfig for
    now. Something like that will be necessary in the future, but those parts
    of strongswan differ significanty from openswan.
